- Lab 2: Parser and AST
- Lab 3: Type checker
- Lab 4: Interpreter
- Lab 5: LLVM IR generator and codegen

Codebase overview
The code uses a layered architecture. Each layer isolates responsibilities and helps students focus on one concept at a time.

- scanner/lexer
  - ANTLR-based lexer and hand-written tokenizer examples
  - Test harness for lexical test cases

- parser
  - ANTLR grammars and generated parsers
  - Error recovery strategies
  - AST builder

- ast
  - Node types
  - Visitor interfaces
  - Pretty printer and serializer

- typechecker
  - Environment and scope handling
  - Constraint generation and solving
  - Inference engine

- interpreter
  - Bytecode interpreter for the internal VM
  - Direct AST interpreter
  - Memory and object model

- codegen
  - LLVM IR emission
  - Calling convention handling
  - Runtime support stubs

- runtime
  - Minimal runtime library in C
  - Memory management primitives
  - Standard library functions

ANTLR grammars
The repo provides ANTLR v4 grammars and example usage.

- grammar/CPL.g4 â€” full language grammar
- grammar/Expressions.g4 â€” focus on expressions and precedence
- grammar/Patterns.g4 â€” pattern matching grammar

Usage
- Generate parser:
  java -jar antlr-4.9.3-complete.jar -Dlanguage=Java -visitor -package cpl.parser grammar/CPL.g4

- Integrate parser into code:
  - Use the provided visitor to build an AST.
  - Add custom error listener for user-friendly errors.

Error handling strategies
- Fail-fast vs error recovery
- Token insertion and deletion
- Panic-mode recovery for long inputs

Interpreter design
The interpreter follows a straightforward visitor pattern for AST traversal. We provide two interpreters:

1. AST interpreter
   - Evaluate expressions by walking AST nodes.
   - Use environment maps for variable binding.
   - Support closures through lexical environments.

2. Bytecode VM
   - A small stack-based VM.
   - Instructions: push, pop, load, store, call, ret, jump, branch.
   - Implement tail-call optimization at bytecode level.

Sample AST interpreter pseudo-code
- Visit BinaryExpr:
  left = visit(node.left)
  right = visit(node.right)
  switch node.op:
    case PLUS: return left + right
    case MUL: return left * right

- Visit FunctionDecl:
  closure = makeClosure(node.params, node.body, currentEnv)
  currentEnv.define(node.name, closure)

Memory model
- Stack frames for function calls
- Heap for mutable objects
- GC hooks in runtime for demo purposes

LLVM IR backend
We include an LLVM IR backend that converts AST to LLVM IR. The backend uses standard techniques and includes utility modules for type mapping and symbol table handling.

Key parts
- llvm/emitter â€” maps AST nodes to LLVM IR constructs
- llvm/types â€” translates CPL types to LLVM types
- llvm/runtime â€” runtime support in LLVM and C

Building LLVM IR
- Generate IR:
  mvn -pl llvm package
  java -jar target/cpl-llvm-generator.jar examples/factorial.cpl -o out/factorial.ll

- Compile to native:
  clang out/factorial.ll -o out/factorial

- Run:
  ./out/factorial

Calling convention
- Use C calling convention for interop with runtime.
- Pass pointers for strings and arrays.
- Return values in standard registers.

Garbage collection
- Provide a basic mark-and-sweep implementation in the runtime.
- Show how to replace it with a tracing GC.

Code generation patterns
The repo explains common code generation patterns:
- Expression lowering
- Short-circuit boolean logic
- Control-flow lowering (if, while, switch)
- Function prologue and epilogue
- Tail-call optimization
- Closure conversion for first-class functions

Examples
- Expression lowering: compile (a + b) * c to temporary registers and operations
- Short-circuit:
  - Compile (x && y) to branch-based sequence that avoids evaluating y when x is false

Optimization notes
- Constant folding at AST level
- Dead code elimination pass
- Inlining heuristics for small functions
- Register allocation via simple linear-scan

Build and run examples
This section lists commands and examples to run the provided demos.

Contributing guide
We welcome contributions that improve learning resources, fix errors, or add labs.

How to contribute
- Open an issue first if you plan a larger change.
- Fork and create a branch.
- Keep commits small and focused.
- Write tests for new behavior.
- Add a short entry to CHANGELOG.md for non-trivial updates.

Coding standards
- Java: follow Google Java Style guidelines
- Shell scripts: use POSIX shell when possible
- Python: use PEP8
- Document new APIs in docs/

Mentoring tips for instructors
- Use labs in pairs to encourage discussion.
- Use automated tests to provide instant feedback.
- Keep exercises incremental and cumulative.
- Provide grading rubrics with sample solutions.

Teaching slides and sample speech notes
Slides include speaker notes with prompts and key points. Example prompts:
- Why separate lexing and parsing?
- When choose top-down vs bottom-up parsing?
- How does closure conversion affect calling convention?

Reference implementations
Each major component has a reference implementation in src/reference/ to help students test their solutions against a known good baseline.

Code examples and snippets
- Closure creation:
  function makeClosure(params, body, env) {
    return { params, body, env };
  }

- Tail-call detection:
  if (isTailPosition(callNode)) {
    emitTailCall(callNode);
  } else {
    emitRegularCall(callNode);
  }

- LLVM IR snippet for function:
  define i64 @fact(i64 %n) {
  entry:
    %cmp = icmp eq i64 %n, 0
    br i1 %cmp, label %base, label %rec
  base:
    ret i64 1
  rec:
    %n1 = sub i64 %n, 1
    %tmp = call i64 @fact(i64 %n1)
    %res = mul i64 %n, %tmp
    ret i64 %res
  }

Security and sandboxing
- The interpreter runs untrusted student code in a sandbox for labs.
- The runner isolates file and network I/O.
- The Docker image uses user namespaces and process restrictions.

Academic integrity
- Provide a clear policy for collaboration and allowed resources.
- Use automated plagiarism detection for code when needed.
- Encourage original work and peer review.

Q: How do I build from source if a release is not available?  
A: Build with Maven: mvn package. Follow platform notes for LLVM if you use the backend.

Q: I cannot run the runner script on macOS.  
A: Ensure script is executable (chmod +x) and use ./cpl-runner.sh. For macOS ARM, use the correct binary from the releases or build from source.

Q: Where are solution files?  
A: Solutions live in exercises/solutions. Instructors can copy them to private course systems.
